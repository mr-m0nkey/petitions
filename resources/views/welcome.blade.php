                Who is the imposter?
            </div>
            <p>2 masks of unknown origin were found in my house today. All 4 suspects have been notified and have been
                asked to confess but all remain quiet. Now they must rat each other out by voting for who they think
                owns the masks</p>
            <p>16:10: One person suspects Ope, Ope denies</p>
            <p>The person takes back their vote(coward oshi)<p>
                    <p>16:20: Nobody can be trusted, more people cast their votes. Tensions rise</p>
                    <p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Mide: 1 vote</li>
                            <li>Ore: 1 vote</li>
                            <li>Kayode: 1 vote</li>
                            <li>Mayowa: 1 vote</li>
                        </ul>
                    </p>

                    <p>Accusations everywhere as more people vote
                        <ul>
                            <li>Mide: 2 vots (suspect still dey correct my typo) *votes</li>
                            <li>Ore: 1 vote</li>
                            <li>Kayode: 2 votes</li>
                            <li>Mayowa: 1 vote</li>
                        </ul>
                    </p>


                    <p>16:27: One person breaks under pressure and confesses to owning one of the masks. They couldn't
                        deny the evidence provided. But one mask still remains unclaimed</p>
                    <p>The other suspects have been notified of the confession but don't know who confessed, suspense
                        rises.</p>


                    <p>16:38: Another confession, but the trust has already been broken. Nobody still knows who owns
                        both masks except the moderator. Some have been accused unjustly by those they once considered
                        friends</p>
                    <p>16:48: One person refuses to vote</p>
                    <p>18:58: Someone has claimed the votes of the weyrey who decided not to vote
                        <ul>
                            <li>Mide: 3 votes</li>
                            <li>Ore: 2 votes</li>
                            <li>Kayode: 2 votes</li>
                            <li>Mayowa: 1 vote</li>
                        </ul>
