                Who is the imposter?
            </div>
            <p>Two face masks(probably infected with Corona) of unknown origin were found in my house today. All 4 suspects have been notified and have been
                asked to confess but all remain quiet. Now they must rat each other out by voting for who they think
                owns the masks</p>
            <p>16:10: One person suspects Ope, Ope denies</p>
            <p>The person takes back their vote(coward oshi)<p>
                    <p>16:20: Nobody can be trusted, more people cast their votes. Tensions rise</p>
                    <p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Mide: 1 vote</li>
                            <li>Ore: 1 vote</li>
                            <li>Kayode: 1 vote</li>
                            <li>Mayowa: 1 vote</li>
                        </ul>
                    </p>

                    <p>Accusations everywhere as more people vote
                        <ul>
                            <li>Mide: 2 vots (suspect still dey correct my typo) *votes</li>
                            <li>Ore: 1 vote</li>
                            <li>Kayode: 2 votes</li>
                            <li>Mayowa: 1 vote</li>
                        </ul>
                    </p>


                    <p>16:27: One person breaks under pressure and confesses to owning one of the masks. They couldn't
                        deny the evidence provided. But one mask still remains unclaimed</p>
                    <p>The other suspects have been notified of the confession but don't know who confessed, suspense
                        rises.</p>


                    <p>16:38: Another confession, but the trust has already been broken. Nobody still knows who owns
                        both masks except the moderator. Some have been accused unjustly by those they once considered
                        friends</p>
                    <p>16:48: One person refuses to vote</p>
                    <p>18:58: Someone has claimed the votes of the weyrey who decided not to vote
                        <ul>
                            <li>Mide: 3 votes</li>
                            <li>Ore: 2 votes</li>
                            <li>Kayode: 2 votes</li>
                            <li>Mayowa: 1 vote</li>
                        </ul>

                    </p>

                    <p>19:00: Members of the general public have been given the opportunity to vote.(DM your votes)</p>
                    <p>Suspects: Mide, Kayode, Ore, Mayowa, Ope</p>
                    <p>19:11: A vote has been cast against Kayode.
                    <ul>
                            <li>Mide: 3 votes</li>
                            <li>Ore: 2 votes</li>
                            <li>Kayode: 3 votes</li>
                            <li>Mayowa: 1 vote</li>
                        </ul>
                    </p>


                    <p>19:12: "I don't know who Mide is but the name seems like a culprit" - An observation from a member of the general public</p>
                    <p>19:24: "LMFAO, I could swear it was kayode" - A concerned citizen
                    <ul>
                            <li>Kayode: 4 votes</li>
                            <li>Mide: 3 votes</li>
                            <li>Ore: 2 votes</li>
                            <li>Mayowa: 1 vote</li>
                        </ul>
                    </p>

                    <p>19:26: It seems the suspect known with the government name of Kayode is a prime suspect as another member of the public votes for him. "Iâ€™m voting him 3 times"</p>
                    <p>Luckily for Kayode, they only get one vote
                    <ul>
                            <li>Kayode: 5 votes</li>
                            <li>Mide: 3 votes</li>
                            <li>Ore: 2 votes</li>
                            <li>Mayowa: 1 vote</li>
                        </ul>
                    </p>

                    <p>Ope still doesn't have a single vote against his name</p>


                    <p>"Person vote kayode 3 times lmfao, now I feel bad for him, but his name too sketchy" - One of the people that voted for Kayode.</p>
                    <p>21:29: Another vote for Kayode. nawa. "Whatever happened... He did that shit"
                    <ul>
                            <li>Kayode: 6 votes</li>
                            <li>Mide: 3 votes</li>
                            <li>Ore: 2 votes</li>
                            <li>Mayowa: 1 vote</li>
                        </ul>
                    </p>

                    <p>10:00: The moment of truth is upon us. Who is the imposter?</p>
                    <p>There are 2 imposters among us</p>
                    <p>Ope owns one of the masks, but nobody voted for him. He was also the first to confess</p>

                    <p>The second imposter might shock you. You thought it was Kayode, <span class="bold">BUT IT WAS I, MAYOWA</span>. It was an old mask I forgot I had. Only one person came close to the truth</p>
